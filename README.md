# yuuvis® Youtube Demo


This houses the Python yuuvis® youtube demo.  

1. You will need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine first. But how do you know if you already have it or not? Well on MAC's it is already installed so you can simply open up your favorite Terminal and type.
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7 
```
You should see the Python version that is currently installed on your Mac, you still need to update the version to the newest version Python 3.7 or higher for this tutorial.

For Windows you will need download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. The next important tool you will need is "pip", Start by checking if you have it instaled aready by runing in the command line
```
$ pip -V

pip 19.1.1 from c:\users\james\appdata\local\programs\python\python37-32\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.7)

```
If you don't already have it then you can head over to [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and follow the step provided. Pip is what you will use in Python to download any packages or bundle that you may need to add to your machine. It's a similar package manager to NPM or BRRW for installing packages.

3. Next you will need to download Flask1.1.1 using the link provied and following the steps.  [https://pypi.org/project/Flask/](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)

4. Getting stared you will then open your Python IDE or in the respected repository you will need to open the Command line and run the Python file "yuuvis_demo_site.py." From there you can view it at "127.0.0.1" in your Chrome browser.
